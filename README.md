# Hi, I'm Roxanne, a Berlin-based full-stack web developer and designer with a focus on web accessibility
- An overview of my recent work can be seen on [velma.studio](https://www.velma.studio), a freelancer collective I co-created early 2024.
- Our most important recent project is [pvssy talk.org](https://www.pvssy-talk.org).
- Since July 2023, I am certified as a full-stack web developer by Code Academy Berlin.
- Since graduating as a graphic designer in 2012 (ERACOM, Lausanne), I have expanded into web design, UI/UX over time.

## Web Development üç≤
While I remain flexible to learn new technologies over time, I believe the best soups are made with Next.js + Typescript, TailwindCSS, [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io). Agremented with Firebase/Firestore, Stripe, Shopify, GSAP, depending on the project needs.

## Web Design üå∂Ô∏è
With over 10 years of experience in web design and a background in graphic design, I‚Äôm skilled at creating responsive mockups using Figma‚Äôs component system. This background also helps me develop components kinda directly, bypassing the lengthy mockup process, integrating them smoothly into existing website design systems and speeding up the process.

## Web Accessibility ü´ö
As of 2019, I specialize in Web Accessibility, ensuring that my code and design is accessible to most users. I am familiar with the WCAG 2.1 AA and AAA for code, design and content.
