# Hi, I'm Roxanne, a Berlin-based full-stack web developer and designer with a focus on web accessibility
- An overview of my recent work can be seen on [velma.studio](https://www.velma.studio), a freelancer collective I co-created in early 2024.
- Since 2023, I have been certified as a full-stack web developer by Code Academy Berlin.
- Since graduating as a graphic designer in 2012 (ERACOM, Lausanne, CH), I have expanded into web design, UI/UX, and CSS integration.

## Web Development 🍲
While I remain flexible to learn new technologies over time, I believe the best soups are made with Next.js + Typescript, TailwindCSS, Sanity.io. Agremented with Firebase/Firestore, Stripe, Shopify, GSAP, depending on the project needs.
  
## Web Accessibility 🫚
As of 2019, I specialize in Web Accessibility, ensuring that my code and design is accessible to most users. I am familiar with the WCAG 2.1 AA and AAA for code, design and content

## Web Design 🌶️
With over 10 years of experience in web design and a background in graphic design, I’m skilled at creating responsive mockups using Figma’s component system. My design background also helps me develop components efficiently, integrating them smoothly into existing design systems and speeding up the process.
