- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Roxanne, graphic and web designer currently at a full stack development bootcamp at Code Academy Berlin.
- ðŸ‘€ As a freelancer during almost 10 years, I have been orienting towards the needs of socially-, educationnally and culturally-oriented projects, creating practical, sustainable and accessible tools. I am very interested and commited to web inclusion and accessibility. ðŸŒˆðŸ’ª
- ðŸŒ± After handling during many years with web developpment, Iâ€™m finally learning full stack dev at Code Academy Berlin. I am excited to see where the combo graphic/web design and development will bring me!
- ðŸ‘¾ Iâ€™m eager to collaborating on new projects focusing on accessibility or more broadly oriented towards social change. Feel free to contact me!
