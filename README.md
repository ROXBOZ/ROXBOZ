# Hi, I'm Roxanne, an intermediate-Level Full-Stack Web Developer with strong skills in UI systems and web accessibility
- I am seeking a full-time, Berlin-based position as a Frontend/Fullstack Web Developer, ideally with an emphasis on UI/UX and A11Y.
- Co-created Velma Studio in 2023, where I have been working as a JAMstack Developer with Next.js, TypeScript and Sanity.
- Certified Full-Stack Web Developer (Code Academy Berlin, July 2023).
- Graduated in Graphic Design (ERACOM, Lausanne, 2012), with a shift to Web Design and UI/UX around 2015.
- Since 2021, I have been certified Web Accessibility, ensuring that my code, design, and content meet the WCAG 2.1 AA standards. I use a combination of automated checks with pa11y, a checklist of all WCAG standards to manually verify what automation cannot catch, as well as an additional check list of web inclusion best practices. Sanity CMS is enhanced with accessibility validation tools.
