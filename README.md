## Web Accessibility 🫚

I am not putting any important repository in _public_ since my projects are for clients (I’ll spare you my studies repos, I’m nice). Curious nevertheless, [reach out to me](mailto:hello@roxanne-borloz.net) and I’ll show you!

I am actively looking to join a team in a company where I could contribute and grow technically. [reach out to me](mailto:hello@roxanne-borloz.net)!
